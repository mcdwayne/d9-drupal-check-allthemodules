JsonLog Drupal 8
----------------

Intro
-----
This module is ported from Drupal 7 and is inspired by Drupal 8's core syslog module.
The module works in a similar way as in D7, with the same configuration options.
Configuration options can also now be found on /admin/config/development/logging .

Of course it implements core's LoggerInterface to replace D7's hook_watchdog.


Dependencies
------------
The module has no dependencies and can work standalone.
It does however work perfectly together with dblog and syslog modules.

Drush support has not been ported and thus it is not available in D8 version (currently).


Credits
-------
