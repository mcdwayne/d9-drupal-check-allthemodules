THERMOMETER
===========

The thermometer module provides a block to allow you to create a simple thermometer widget, useful for fundraising goals, without relying on an external third-party service, etc. It also uses CSS and Javascript, and not any Flash, etc.


CONFIG OPTIONS
==============

Enable the module. Go to the blocks page and configure the “Progress Thermometer" block. Place it where you want to see it! Configuration is available when you first place the block, and anytime thereafter by accessing it from the blocks page.

 * Progress so Far: Current amount raised towards your goal
 * Goal: Target amount of funds you want to raise
 * Button Text: Text for the donate button. Leave blank to not show a donate button.
 * Button URL: URL to page where people can donate.
 * Open in New Window: Enable to open the donate button url in a new window. Enabled by default.


THEMING
=======

The output is themeable, but beware that the JavaScript depends on the markup to a certain extent. Copy the thermometer.html.twig file in thermometer/templates to your themes folder to make modifications.
