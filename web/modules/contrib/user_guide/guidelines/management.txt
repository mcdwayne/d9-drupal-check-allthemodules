[[management-channels]]
==== Communication channels

Tasks that need to be done, and content or organizational problems with the
guide, are tracked in _issues_ (which may be known as "bugs" or "feature
requests" in other tracking systems, but Drupal.org calls them "issues"). You
can see all the issues for the project on project_issues_link. There is some
background information on Drupal.org projects and issues on
<<practicalities-project>>.

Project announcements are posted to the
https://groups.drupal.org/documentation[Documentation group on
groups.drupal.org]. They are also announced on the
https://twitter.com/drupaldocs[@drupaldocs] twitter account.

Meetings for the project may be held in the #drupal-docs IRC channel,
and you can feel free to "ping" project coordinators in this channel if they are
there and you have a quick question. To learn more about IRC, see
https://drupal.org/irc

There is also an email list for this project, which is voluntary for project
participants to join. You can join the list or view the archives at:
https://groups.google.com/d/forum/d8manual
Note that if you post
to the list, your post will be viewable by the public.
