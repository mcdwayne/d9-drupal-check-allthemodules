=== Following the Scenario

[role="summary"]
Information about how to make the project_name a more coherent whole, by
following a common website building scenario that is used throughout.

The project_name has a scenario that is used to provide unity and context to the
topics. Keep the scenario in mind as you write your topics, especially when
writing tasks (for example, if writing a task about creating a content type for
a web site, the example should be one of the content types needed to create the
scenario site).

The scenario can be found in the Preface section of the project_name.

The following sections contain specifics of how to follow the scenario.


[[scenario-example]]
==== Use the scenario as an example

When writing a task topic, in the Goal, Site prerequisites, Steps, and Expand
your understanding sections, use the scenario as an example. For instance, in a
topic about creating content types, if the scenario is about creating a web site
for a farmers market, these sections could be something like:

Goal::
  Create a new content type; for example, a Vendor content type for market
  vendor profiles.
Steps::
  When describing how to fill in the form, your example data values would be
  for the Vendor content type.
Expand your understanding::
  Create another content type, such as for the Recipe content type.


[[scenario-profile]]
==== Assume previous tasks have been completed

When writing task topics and making screen shots, assume that the previous tasks
have already been completed in the site. However, make sure to list site
prerequisites, such as particular content types with particular fields needing
to exist, as well as some particular content, in order to create and test a
particular view that uses them.


[[scenario-assets]]
==== Use the provided assets

The project includes several assets (text, images, and color instructions). The
images are license-compatible with the project, and can be used anywhere that is
appropriate. Use these assets as follows:

* When providing sample values for form completion, copy and paste the
text and/or color instructions in appropriate fields.

* When setting up the site for making screen shots of the result of a task,
use the provided text, colors, and images.

These assets can be found in the project_cgit_assets_folder_link (click the
"plain" link next to a file name to view it). See also
