// This template is for a topic that covers a concept.
//
// To use this template:
// - Copy it to your source directory with a new name, such as
//   "blocks-overview.txt". [The project coordinators may already have done
//   that for you.]
// - Follow the instructions that are contained in lines starting with //
//   throughout this file.
// - Replace placeholder text with your content.
// - Before you submit your topic, remove all the lines in the file that
//   start with // -- these are comments that do not belong in the topic. Also
//   remove any blank lines that are before the ID line.
// - Then, if there are sections that do not apply to your topic (for example,
//   Prerequisites might not), put // before the ==== on that line and leave
//   those lines in the topic file. So it would look like:
//==== Prerequisite knowledge


// The first thing in the file is an ID: replace the text in the brackets below
// so that it matches the name of the file (without the .txt extension; for
// example, [[block-overview]] if the file name is block-overview.txt.
[[id-goes-here]]
// The topic title goes on this line. Use "Title Case" for topic titles.
// Titles for Concept topics should start with "Concept: ".
=== Title Goes Here

// The next thing that is needed is an entry for the index:
// - Replace the text in (((indexentry))) with an appropriate index entry,
//   such as (((Blocks,overview))). You can add additional index entries if
//   appropriate.
// - Refer to the Guidelines if you have questions.
// - Also remove the // before the ((( so that this becomes an index entry
//   and not a comment.
//(((indexentry)))


==== Prerequisite knowledge

// This section should mostly link to topic and concept tasks within
// the guide that someone would need to understand before trying this task.
// Some of the entries could be background knowledge that is needed that is
// not covered in the guide.
//
// Some ideas (remove the // to make these not comments):
//* <<cross-reference-one>>
//* <<cross-reference-two>>
//* How to upload files from your local server to your web server.

Remove this placeholder text.


==== What is a ...?

// Describe your concept here. The title of this section should be
// What is a ...? or What are ...? (where the ... is the same as the topic
// title). If the topic title contains several things to describe, you can also
// have multiple of these "What is a ..." sections.
//
// If possible, relate this concept to the specific scenario of the guide,
// perhaps using "for example" language.

Remove this placeholder text.


==== Related topics

// In this section, make cross-references to related tasks and concepts that
// are covered in this book.
// Also remove the // so these lines are a list and not comments:
//* <<cross-reference-1>>
//* <<cross-reference-2>>

Remove this placeholder text.


==== Videos

// In this section, embed videos that exactly cover this topic. For videos
// that are related but do not exactly cover the topic, add links in the
// Additional resources section instead.
//
// Syntax to embed a video (remove the // to make it not a comment, and make
// sure the word "video" starts at the left margin of your text file):
//   video::https://www.youtube.com/embed/HymQsDOcT3E[title="Name of video"]

Remove this placeholder text.


==== Additional resources

// In this section, make a list of outside references: videos, Drupal.org
// documentation, etc. Make sure all links have link text showing the name
// of the article or page being linked to.
