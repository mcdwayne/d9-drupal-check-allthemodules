[replacements]

# Note: Things like bold and italics happen before replacments. Links and other
# macros happen afterwards. So if you want to use bold/italics, you will need to
# use the DocBook equivalents instead:
# - italics: <emphasis>text</emphasis>
# - bold:  <emphasis role="strong">text</emphasis>
