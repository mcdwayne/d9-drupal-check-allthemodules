The Page manager search module adds the ability for Page manager pages to be
searchable via the Drupal core Search module or the Search API module.

**Note**: The Page manager search module doesn't do anything on it's own. This module will 
create `Page Manager Search` Content Entity which will collect data from each `Page Variant` 
Config Entity.

You can use this module at one's own risk because it is raw version.
