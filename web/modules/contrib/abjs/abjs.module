 * @return string
 *   A string of javascript for running all tests.
 *
 *   - abTests will be an array of test objects. Each abTest object has these
 *     properties:
 *   -- name: The name of the test, equal to the test id. This will be used as
 *      the name of the cookie that gets assigned this test, prefixed by
 *      abjs_cookie_prefix from the variables table.
 *   -- conditions: An array of condition strings with the names of the
 *      condition functions to run. The condition strings are prefixed by con_,
 *      followed by the primary id from the test table and primary id from the
 *      condition table, which is used instead of the condition table so that we
 *      don't get duplicate function definitions with the same name.
 *   -- experiences: An array of experience objects. Each experience object has
 *      these properties:
 *   --- name: The name of the experience, equal to the experience id. This will
 *       be used as the value of the cookie that gets assigned for this test.
 *   --- fraction: The probability of this experience getting chosen. If all
 *       experience probabilities for a single test add to less than 1, the
 *       remainder is the probability that a user will not be in the test on
 *       each page hit. If probabilities add to greater than 1, experiences may
 *       have less than their stated probability of occurring.
 *   --- script: The name of the function for this experience. The name is
 *       prefixed by exp_, followed by the primary id from the test table and
 *       primary id from the experience table, which is used instead of the
 *       experience table so that we don't get duplicate function definitions
 *       with the same name.
 *   - abConditions will be an array of condition functions that apply to the
 *     active tests, named the same as abTest.conditions above, and using the
 *     condition script from the condition table.
 *   - abExperiences will be an array of experience functions that apply to the
 *     active tests, named the same as abTest.experiences above, and using the
 *     experience script from the experience table.
