INTRODUCTION
------------

The Migrate Devel module adds utilities to help out developers when creating
migrations.

 * For a full description of the module, visit the project page:
   https://drupal.org/project/migrate_devel

 * To submit bug reports and feature suggestions, or to track changes:
   https://drupal.org/project/issues/migrate_devel


REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the modules outside of Drupal core:

 * [devel](https://www.drupal.org/project/devel)


RECOMMENDED MODULES
-------------------
 
 * [migrate_tools](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_tools)
 * [migrate_run](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_run)
 * [config_update](https://www.drupal.org/project/config_update)
 * [migrate_plus](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_plus)


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. Visit:
   https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for further information.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

Currently uses Kint (from devel) directly to print out debug information 
instead of devel in order to take advantage of 
cli coloring and named variable debugging.

Options are:

* `--migrate-debug` - Prints out rows as they run.
  Can be used in `migrate-import` or `migrate-status` and will revert
  existing migrations to the default and clear the cache for them.
  This requires [config_update](https://www.drupal.org/project/config_update)
  if you use [migrate_plus](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_plus)
  because migrations go into config.
* `--migrate-debug-pre` - Same as above before the process is run on the row.
  Can be used in `migrate-import`.
