INTRODUCTION
------------

This small module allows you to place the metadata panel (containing
menu settings, URL path settings, authoring informations, promotions options,
etc.) under the node main form and displayed as vertical tabs.

You can configure the module and choose on which content type you want display
this metadata panel as vertical tabs under the main node form.

This is particularly useful if you use Field group module to organize the node
form as vertical tabs. And this is necessary if you use paragraphs module.
Because then you often need to have the full width of the browser available to
keep a node form usable.
