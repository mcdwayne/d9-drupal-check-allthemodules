## Introduction
This module leverages the power of extra fields through the plugin system
allowing developers to implement any kind of extra field in the form of plugins. 
This plugins can be placed on 
the view or form display of any given entity-type through
the Field UI. Also each plugin has it own instance that can be configured
 different per display or even different entity types (as long the
 implementation allows it).

## Requirements
None.

## Installation
Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. Visit: [https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7] for further information.

## Configuration
This module does not need any further coonfiguration, though each implemented 
plugin can require its own configuration that will be set from the Field UI.

## FAQ
Working on it.
