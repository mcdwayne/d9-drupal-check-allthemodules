INTRODUCTION
------------

Social Auth Dropbox is a Dropbox authentication integration for Drupal. It is
based on the Social Auth and Social API projects

It adds to the site:
 * A new url: /user/login/dropbox.
 * A settings form at /admin/config/social-api/social-auth/dropbox.
 * A Dropbox logo in the Social Auth Login block.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the following modules:

 * Social Auth (https://drupal.org/project/social_auth)
 * Social API (https://drupal.org/project/social_api)


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Run composer to install dependencies:
   composer require "drupal/social_auth_dropbox:^2.0"

 * Install the dependencies: Social API and Social Auth.

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
   https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8
   for further information.

 * A more comprehensive installation instruction for Drupal 8 can be found at
   https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/social-api/social-api-2x/social-auth-2x/social-auth-dropbox-2x-installation


CONFIGURATION
-------------

 * Add your Dropbox project OAuth information in
   Configuration » User Authentication » Dropbox.

 * Place a Social Auth Login block in Structure » Block Layout.

 * If you already have a Social Auth Login block in the site, rebuild the cache.


HOW IT WORKS
------------

The user can click on the Dropbox logo on the Social Auth Login block
You can also add a button or link anywhere on the site that points
to /user/login/dropbox, so theming and customizing the button or link
is very flexible.

After Dropbox has returned the user to your site, the module compares the user
id or email address provided by Dropbox. If the user has previously registered
using Dropbox or your site already has an account with the same email address,
the user is logged in. If not, a new user account is created. Also, a Dropbox
account can be associated with an authenticated user.
