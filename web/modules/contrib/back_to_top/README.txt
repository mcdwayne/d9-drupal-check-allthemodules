Back To Top
-----------

Back To Top adds a button that hovers in the bottom of your screen and allow users to smoothly scroll up the page using jQuery.

Back To Top uses jQuery UI library effects for smooth easing of scroll.

There are settings for:
-----------------------

  * Preventing the button to appear in mobile or touch devices (only works if page caching is not active, because it's a server-side behavior)
  * Choosing between a image och text/css button
  * Placement of the button
  * Appearance of the text/css button


Road map
--------
More settings in admin will be added for changing some of the behaviour.
