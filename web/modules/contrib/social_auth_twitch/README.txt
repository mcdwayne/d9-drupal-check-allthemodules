INTRODUCTION
------------

Social Auth Twitch is a Twitch authentication integration for Drupal. It is
based on the Social Auth and Social API projects


REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the following modules:

 * Social Auth (https://drupal.org/project/social_auth)
 * Social API (https://drupal.org/project/social_api)


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Run composer to install dependencies:
   composer require "drupal/social_auth_twitch:~2.0"

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.
   See https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8
   for further information.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

 * Add your Twitch project OAuth information in
   Configuration » User Authentication » Twitch.

 * Place a Social Auth Twitch block in Structure » Block Layout.

 * If you already have a Social Auth Login block in the site, rebuild the cache.


HOW IT WORKS
------------

User can click on the Twitch logo on the Social Auth Login block.
You can also add a button or link anywhere on the site that points
to /user/login/twitch, so theming and customizing the button or link
is very flexible.

When the user opens the /user/login/twitch link, it automatically takes
user to Twitch for authentication. Twitch then returns the user to Drupal site.
If we have an existing Drupal user with the same email address provided by
Twitch, that user is logged in. Otherwise, a new Drupal user is created.
