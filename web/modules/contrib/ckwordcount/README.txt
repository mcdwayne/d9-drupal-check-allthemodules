CKEditor Word Count & Character Count
==================

Description
============
CKEditor Wordcount can be enabled per filter format, and will show you the paragraph and word count, as well as count
spaces as characters or count HTML as characters if you select those options. You can also set a maximum limit on total
words or total characters, which will prevent input in CKEditor after that limit.

Please note that while you can have a maximum limit imposed by this plugin, do not lean on that for any real character
limit validation.

Installation
============
1. Download the plugin from http://ckeditor.com/addon/wordcount
2. Place the plugin in the root libraries folder (/libraries).
3. Enable CKEditor Wordcount module in the Drupal admin.

Each filter format will now have a config tab for this plugin.

Dependencies
============
This module requires the core CKEditor module and CKEditor Notification module.

Uninstallation
============
1. Uninstall the module from 'Administer >> Modules'.
