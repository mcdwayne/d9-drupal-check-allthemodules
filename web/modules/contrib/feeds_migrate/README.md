## Feeds Migrate
Feeds Migrate is a tool that helps import data into your Drupal 8 website. It
provides a user interface for migrations, so users don’t have to set up the
migrations with code. The goal is to provide a tool anyone can use, regardless
of tech background, to import data into their site.

Why does it matter?
If you are trying to upgrade to Drupal 8 and have existing content, you probably
don’t want to spend hours typing in the content through the Drupal admin
interface. You’d want to use a tool to import the data into your new platform...
Feeds Migrate is that tool.

*This module has deep roots in the Feeds community and mimics the Feeds module
workflow very closely.

**The development version is a work in progress and not functional at the
moment.
DO NOT INSTALL IT ON PRODUCTION.
