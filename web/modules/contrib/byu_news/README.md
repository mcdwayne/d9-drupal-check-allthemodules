BYU News Drupal 8 Module


This module pulls in the recent news articles for the Academic Category. It creates a block listing the 3 most recent Academic news articles. 
You can see a demonstration of this module on the BYU homepage: https://www.byu.edu/academics

## Next Updates to This Module
We'd like to add the category option so there can be multiple news blocks and each could have a configuration option for which category to use and how many news articles to list.
