the required libraries.

  Klarna Checkout specific settings available:
  - Merchant ID (test/live);
  - Password (test/live);
  - Path to terms and conditions page;
  - Language.
  API credentials are provided by the Klarna Checkout merchant account.

* Checkout flow
  Klarna Checkout module adds "Klarna Confirmation message" checkout pane to
  complete phase by default
  - If Klarna Checkout is only payment gateway in your store, you may want to
  disable "Completion message" pane
  - If you use other payment gateways along with Klarna Checkout, you may want
  to define custom "Completion message" pane (that is not visible when
  Klarna Checkout payment method is selected)

* Order workflow
  Please edit your order type to select one of the workflows with validation.
  - Commerce order is placed when user has completed a purchase and the confirmation
  snippet is shown at order complete phase.
  - Commerce order is validated (and payment state set to completed) once push
  notification from Klarna have been received.
