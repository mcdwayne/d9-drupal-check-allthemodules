INTRODUCTION
------------

The Queue Watcher module lets you define automatic checks
for specific queues regarding their overall size.

A queue might get bloated due to missing or too slow worker jobs.
With this module, you can define size limits a queue shouldn't exceed.
During each cron run, the Queue Watcher checks the sizes of the queues
and sends reports to certain E-Mail addresses
and the logging system in case of exceeded limits.

The module also adds some Drush helper commands, e.g.
<code>$ drush queue-watcher-lookup</code>

.. to get a list of currently existent queues with their states and for
optionally sending reports to the configured recipients (mails and/or logs).

Furthermore you can see a status summary of your queue states in the status report.

INSTALLATION
------------
